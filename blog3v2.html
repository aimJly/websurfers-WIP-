      <h2>The search for the right resources
    </h2>
   
      <p>Some text..</p>
      <p> I‚Äôd say the world we live in is full of overconsumption, never ending content can be found anywhere you look at, and little time to consume it all. Even after a few mins sometimes I find myself hooked to learn more.
        <br> <br>
      I‚Äôve noticed that many websites make me want to know how this animation works. Just how does it work? Sure for one thing the dev tools inspector is useful, highlights areas I want, and knowing what css is used for the animations.  My questions are not always answered though.
      Then I begin the search. 
      <br> <br>
      After long hours,online resources/tools show me solutions to my already exhausted brain. I came back not able to consume everything. I think it‚Äôs because it just takes time to go inside the brain to process first. Or I just need to focus on one thing at a time before I make another decision.
      </p>
      <h2>
      Essentials of websites: layouts
       
       </h2>
       <p> 
       BOXES. Every website has boxes in boxes, that show content in content, to show you what services are offered.And what value this provides. It is the layout and skeleton of a website that's all organized in a grid, rows and columns, the 2 by 2 kind of thing. Then it‚Äôs all organized in a way the user knows what is most important to look at.
       
       Without layouts navigation will be tricky, pieces of information in places disorganized and unreadable. Sooner afterword we won‚Äôt be coming back.

        <h2>Blogging is kinda..</h2>
        <p>I used to think blogging is boring, super long details of people‚Äôs life when my only intention is to figure out how to learn a craft then read an online diary. Just get to the point of what I‚Äôm here for.
        This is why I think a table of contents is a must have for any blog.<br> <br>
         Well not all blogs are ‚Äúblogs about my family‚Äù, many are how to‚Äôs, learning a topic to be more knowledgeable about, a guide. I liked how the introductions are interesting, and tell the main points.
         <br> <br>
        These informational articles are what I want to ‚Äúwrite: or type about. Yet it might take a while for me to educate myself before I start teaching others.

         <h2> Website builders thoughts</h2>
         <p>My thoughts on website builders

         U might have noticed the url, long to read , and hard to remember. I have tried to find another way to get this url customized. The only way to be fully customized is through paid domain names. <br> <br>
         Google sites an easy beginner website builder, with an option for customized urls. <br>No code required and easy to navigate. The icons are similar to other google services. Like docs, or email. But other website builders' interfaces seem to top or bottom, some options shown or hidden behind the menu.
         <br> <br>
          Some website builders are much more intuitive, thinking based on exactly what customers want for their companies. <br>A CMS (content management system) to manage many products at once, and professional, almost finished website templates. and Sometimes I can mistake a website builder for adobe spark(express). 
          <br> <br>
         Their ease of use, the drag and drop feature is convenient to have, Just instantly knowing what it would look like.<br>
         Does my website look better with a card layout, a color font or animations? 
         But these drag and drop features separate from hand coding. <br>
         And have many other limitations that in the long run I would rather hand code in a code editor. 
         
          </P>
