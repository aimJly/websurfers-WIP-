        <h1>Website review: JS Turbo Racer </h1>
  <p>A retro wave theme, bright sunset sky, and it's almost alien like astmosphrere. This online racer fullfills that dream: highway speed driving with drift music. Well on the screen, not in real life. 
  <br> <br>
  js turbo runs on javascript for the use of it functions and animations. In the web browser, No need for downloads. To play use w:foward, and a, b for left and right. Activate turbo with space and crtl buttons, vroom! Just watch out for the incoming trucks, crash!
  I sometimes don't see those trucks, I get distracted by the palm trees, too detailed!
  <br> <br>
  The top of the screen, theres a playlist of music to vibe to. 
  I personally like the playlist, but sometimes it gets same old, 
  listen to any house, phonk or bounce song instead.
  <br> 
  In the settings you can change the sound, and weather. 
  The Css filters: Difference make for a a true Ufo experience.
  <br> <br>
There is 3 diferent gamemodes, to change the diffculty. 
Theres Turbo gameplay, fastest lap, complete a lap in shortest time possiable is much easier than Out of time which you race the most lap before tick tock, game over.
<br> <br>
Over all I give it a rating of 4 and half stars for it's immersive experince , if the palm trees didn't hurt my eyes I'd rate it higher. 
Be sure to check it out!
